FlowBits makes automation more accessible by giving you simple tools for everyday situations. It does not focus on large features, but on the small things that make a difference.

With a few extra logic cards, building a good flow becomes just a bit easier.

- With step sequences, you can easily go through different steps in a fixed order.
- Flags let you quickly switch functions or states in your flows on or off.
- Modes help you clearly define the general situation in your home.
- No-repeat windows prevent a flow from being triggered multiple times in quick succession.
- Timers give you an easy way to include delays or time intervals in your automations.
