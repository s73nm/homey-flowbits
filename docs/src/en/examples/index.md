# Examples

Real-world scenarios showing how to use FlowBits in your smart home. Each example walks you through a practical use case with step-by-step flows you can recreate.

## Available examples

### [Automatic Hall Lighting](/examples/automatic-hall-lighting)

Create motion-activated hall lighting that dims when idle and brightens when someone walks by. Uses **Modes** and **Timers** to create a smooth, responsive lighting experience.

### [Daypart-Based Modes](/examples/daypart-based-modes)

Automatically switch between Morning, Day, Evening, and Night modes based on time and presence. Uses **Modes** with the Date & Time and Presence apps for seamless daypart transitions.

### [Multi-Scene Light Switch](/examples/multi-scene-light-switch)

Turn a single wall switch into a multi-scene controller. Quick presses cycle through scenes, while a press after a pause turns lights off. Uses **Step Sequences** and **Timers** for intuitive control.
