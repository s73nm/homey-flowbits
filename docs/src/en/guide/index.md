# Guide

FlowBits is a utility app for Homey that helps you structure, control, and extend your flows without adding any new device types. All features are defined and managed directly from flows, giving you full flexibility while keeping your setup clean and predictable.

## Install

Install FlowBits from the [Homey App Store](https://homey.app/en-nl/app/com.basmilius.flowbits/FlowBits/) on your Homey. The app requires no additional configuration—once installed, all FlowBits features become available as flow cards.

## Experimental release

An experimental build is also available for users who want to test upcoming features. This version can be downloaded from the [experimental release page](https://homey.app/en-nl/app/com.basmilius.flowbits/FlowBits/test/).
