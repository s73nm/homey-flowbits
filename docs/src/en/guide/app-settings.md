# App Settings <VPBadge type="info" text="1.6.0+"/>

FlowBits includes a settings page where you can customize the appearance of your events, flags, labels, and modes. This helps you visually organize your automations and makes widgets more recognizable at a glance.

## Accessing settings

To open the FlowBits settings page:

1. Open the Homey app.
2. Go to **More** → **Settings** → **FlowBits**.

## Customizing appearance

Each event, flag, label, and mode can be given a custom **color** and **icon**. These visual customizations appear in:

- The settings page itself
- Dashboard widgets
- Autocomplete dropdowns in flow cards

To customize an item:

1. Find the item in the appropriate section (Modes, Flags, Labels, or Events).
2. Tap on it to open the editor.
3. Choose a color from the palette.
4. Search for and select an icon.
5. Tap **Save**.

::: tip
Use the search field to quickly find icons by name. Only matching icons are shown to keep the list manageable.

## Sections

### Modes

Lists all modes that have been used in your flows. Customize each mode with a unique color and icon to quickly identify them in widgets and flow cards.

### Flags

Lists all flags that have been used in your flows. Assign colors and icons to make active/inactive states more visually distinct.

### Labels

Lists all labels that have been used in your flows. Adding icons and colors helps identify labels when they appear in widgets.

### Events

Lists all events that have been used in your flows. Customize their appearance to make event tracking more intuitive.

## Statistics

The settings page also displays usage statistics for your FlowBits setup:

- **Total counts** — How many step sequences, events, flags, labels, modes, no-repeat windows, sliders, and timers you've created.
- **Flow card usage** — A breakdown showing how often each FlowBits flow card is used across all your flows.

These statistics help you understand how FlowBits is being used in your setup and can help identify unused or heavily-used features.

## Notes

- Items only appear in settings after they've been used in at least one flow.
- Customizations are saved immediately and sync across all widgets.
- Colors and icons are purely visual — they don't affect flow behavior.
