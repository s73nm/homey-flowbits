# Philosophy

FlowBits is built on a simple principle: **your automations should stay flexible, predictable, and entirely flow-driven**.  
Every feature in FlowBits exists to help you express small pieces of logic clearly, without introducing hidden state or hard-coded behavior.

Rather than building large, complex systems, FlowBits focuses on small, universal tools—flags, modes, timers, signals, step sequences, sliders, and others—that you can combine in any way you like.  
These tools act as building blocks that fit naturally into Homey’s flow-based design.

## Flow-Driven by Design

Everything in FlowBits can be created, updated, and controlled from flows.  
Widgets do not store logic themselves; they simply display the state you assign through flow cards.  
Values are never processed automatically unless you choose to react to them in a flow, preserving full transparency and control.

This approach keeps your system easy to understand: you always know where a change came from, what triggered it, and what it affects.

## Small Tools, Big Possibilities

FlowBits avoids “opinionated” automation.  
Instead of guessing what you want, it provides functions that adapt to your own routines.  
A mode can represent anything.  
A flag can mean whatever you decide.  
A timer, sequence, or slider behaves in a simple, predictable way—so you can mix them into larger behaviors without surprises.

By combining several small features, you can build automations that feel personal, flexible, and maintainable, even as your smart home grows.

## Built for Clarity

Each FlowBits feature is intentionally minimal:

- No hidden actions.
- No automatic decisions.
- No background processing.
- No assumptions about how your home works.

FlowBits gives you the tools; **your flows decide what happens and when**.

The result is a system that stays understandable months or years later—because everything runs exactly the way you defined it.
